# SGMAssignmentRacingGame
This is a racing game done with a group for our class of SGM


The assets we used:
-Some assets for roads from asset store
-Unity default assets for cars
-Some assets for trees and some textures for ground, dirt, grass etc.
-We used the character and animations from the Animation class, but we have implemented the controlling script and state machine.

The scripts (Except for "Suspension") and the map building are our implementations.

The gameplay is available on youtube to watch: https://youtu.be/m6dvqvLAS-4 Enjoy :)


Due to size limitations on github we had to separate the project into parts. In order to get the project do as follows:
1. Put all the archives in the same folder
2. Select all of them
3. Right click -> Extract here
Only one filder should be formed following this procedure.
