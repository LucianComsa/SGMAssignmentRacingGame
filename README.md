# SGMAssignmentRacingGame
This is a racing game done with a group for our class of SGM


The assets we used:
-Some assets for roads from asset store
-Unity default assets for cars
-Some assets for trees and some textures for ground, dirt, grass etc.
-We used the character and animations from the Animation class, but we have implemented the controlling script and state machine.

The scripts (Except for "Suspension") and the map building are our implementations.
